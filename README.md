# check math expression

## Task 1:

Create a function that takes a string input and check if it is a mathematical expression.
Supported operators: +, -, *, /, % and only integers

## Input/Output:

```
"5 + 2" --> true  
"9 * 1" --> true  
"hello world" --> false  
"123" --> false  
"5 + foo" --> false  
```

---

*Addition:* You can become as complex as you like on this one, working with higly complex mathematical expression.



Task 2
=========


# The Secret of Love :
#### Everyone wants to hide their secrets, especially if those are their love's secrets
:bulb: **To help them we will write a Java function to cipher their secrets.**

The function will ask for three arguments : :secret: the secret  , :gift_heart: love name,  :birthday: year of birth.

> **Secret condition** :point_up: : The secret must be at least **8** **characters**.

### The cipher algorithm is :
* Concatenate the love secret with the love name     :arrow_heading_down:
* Reverse the string :arrow_heading_down:
* Concatenate the reversed string with the  year of birth :arrow_heading_down:

>  ***NOTE:*** We need to cipher the secret itself , not to create a new  ciphered string.

### Input
*secret:* this_is_my_secret
*name:* Max
*year:* 1982

### Output
xaMterces_ym_si_siht1982


## Task 3

# replaceAll() in java

## Overview:

The replaceAll() method replaces each substring of this string that matches the given string.
For now we'll ignore the regular expression capabilites.

## Task 3

Write a program that replaces the standalone "dog" in the following sentence with "cat".

## Input/Output
"A dogmatic dog buys dogecoin to become rich and buy hotdogs every day."
-->
"A dogmatic cat buys dogecoin to become rich and buy hotdogs every day."
