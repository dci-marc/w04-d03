This function checks if a given string matches a specific pattern (like simple mathematical operators and numbers). Here's a detailed explanation of each part:

### 1. **Function Definition**
```java
private static boolean isMath(String input)
```
- **`private`**: This keyword means the function can only be used inside the class it is defined in. Other classes can't use this function directly.
- **`static`**: This means the function belongs to the class itself, not to an instance of the class. You can call it without creating an object of the class.
- **`boolean`**: This is the return type of the function, meaning it will give back either `true` or `false`.
- **`isMath`**: This is the name of the function. It follows the common naming pattern for functions that return a boolean (`isSomething`), where `isMath` suggests it checks if something is related to math.
- **`String input`**: The function takes one input, which is a **string** (a series of characters, like words or numbers).

### 2. **Pattern Compilation**
```java
Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile("[\\+\\-\\*\\/0-9]");
```
- **`Pattern pattern`**: This creates a **Pattern** object. A pattern is like a template that tells the computer what kinds of characters to look for.
- **`Pattern.compile("[\\+\\-\\*\\/0-9]")`**: This part defines the pattern we're looking for in the input string. Let’s break down this template:
    - **`[ ]`**: Everything inside the square brackets defines the allowed characters.
    - **`\\+`**: Represents the `+` symbol (used for addition).
    - **`\\-`**: Represents the `-` symbol (used for subtraction).
    - **`\\*`**: Represents the `*` symbol (used for multiplication).
    - **`\\/`**: Represents the `/` symbol (used for division).
    - **`0-9`**: This part means any digit from 0 to 9 is allowed (representing numbers).

This pattern, then, says "find any character that is a number or one of the four basic math operators."

### 3. **Matching the Pattern**
```java
Matcher matcher = pattern.matcher(input);
```
- **`Matcher matcher`**: This creates a **Matcher** object. A matcher is used to check if the input string fits the pattern we created.
- **`pattern.matcher(input)`**: This takes the pattern we defined and tries to apply it to the `input` string (the string given to the function).

### 4. **Returning the Result**
```java
return matcher.matches();
```
- **`matcher.matches()`**: This checks if the **entire** `input` string matches the pattern. If the input string fully fits the pattern (only contains numbers and/or math symbols), this will return `true`. Otherwise, it returns `false`.

### Example Explanation

If we use this function like this:
```java
boolean result = isMath("123+456");
```

Here’s what happens step by step:
1. The pattern `[\\+\\-\\*\\/0-9]` is created to recognize digits and math symbols.
2. The input string `"123+456"` is checked against this pattern.
3. Since all characters in `"123+456"` (numbers and the plus sign) match the pattern, the function returns `true`.

But if we use it like this:
```java
boolean result = isMath("abc+123");
```
- The string `"abc+123"` contains letters (`abc`), which are not part of the pattern.
- Therefore, the function will return `false`.

### Conclusion
This function is designed to check if a string is purely made up of numbers and basic math symbols. If the string contains anything else (like letters or other symbols), the function returns `false`.
